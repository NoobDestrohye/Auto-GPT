1. Use algorithms to combine elements like genre, setting, and core conflict to create a unique story premise. Store this information for reference during the storytelling process.
2. Employ a plot generation algorithm to outline the story’s main events. This should include an introduction, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. The algorithm should aim for a coherent narrative flow.
3. Utilize character generation algorithms to create characters with distinct traits, motivations, and arcs. The characters should be designed to fit cohesively within the story’s world and its central conflict.
4. Implement natural language generation techniques to write the story based on the generated outline and character profiles. Use language models to produce engaging dialogue, vivid descriptions, and appropriate pacing. Include elements like foreshadowing or dramatic irony where fitting.
5.     Use automated editing algorithms to revise the story. This should include checks for grammatical errors, plot inconsistencies, and opportunities to enhance character development or thematic depth.

The AI should also be programmed to iterate on these steps, possibly using feedback loops or reinforcement learning, to continuously improve the quality of its storytelling.
